The way that you're spending your time right now is just so worthless | https://youtu.be/UcrYywntTso?t=2418
Honestly I have no fucking idea how you're 4.7k MMR | https://youtu.be/1i5ogmxO1BU?t=11
You put a whole lotta words to that shit playstyle you developed | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i5ogmxO1BU&t=1356s
I don't think its worth watching the rest of this game honestly, because it's just mistake after mistake now | https://youtu.be/UOg1OPbJL28?t=2185
You have officially made a huge mistake, okay.. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiZzrBWhG4o&feature=youtu.be&t=117
HUUUUGEEE Mistake | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiZzrBWhG4o&feature=youtu.be&t=1331
What has he done in the meantime? He hasn't done shit, he's being buying in the store, he has full mana, hasn't been farming, could've farmed this, could've farmed this. So many things he could've done. | https://youtu.be/UOg1OPbJL28?t=2682
This game is not about you | https://youtu.be/UOg1OPbJL28?t=2688
It's probably because you're low MMR, you don't understand... | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiZzrBWhG4o&feature=youtu.be&t=502
You guys are at 1k MMR because you are weak players, not because your allies are bad. | https://youtu.be/UOg1OPbJL28?t=2999
That's not playing support man. You're just playing a hero that chooses not to farm. That's it. That's all you're doing in this game. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mMmipyJH1g&feature=youtu.be&t=3959
Alright, you super messed up there. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiZzrBWhG4o&feature=youtu.be&t=1925
It's like you're playing League of Legends now honestly.. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mMmipyJH1g&feature=youtu.be&t=3903
That would've been infinitely better than how you have played this game. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiZzrBWhG4o&feature=youtu.be&t=1530
You actually just sunder killed yourself. I am actually really impressed. I am pretty blown away actually. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiZzrBWhG4o&feature=youtu.be&t=2720
And then you start attacking the wrong guy as well. You super messed up. (gniffelend in minachting) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiZzrBWhG4o&feature=youtu.be&t=2742
You can just right click, right click, right click... 6 last hits that you could've gotten right there. You can't do that shit man CMON | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mMmipyJH1g&feature=youtu.be&t=1098
You're basically just going to your lane slowly collecting farm and hoping that your opponents do it slower than you. You're not exerting lane pressure. You're basically not even playing Dota. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mMmipyJH1g&feature=youtu.be&t=1502
Its not your teammates keeping you at 1K MMR. It's your shit farming patterns. Its your inefficient movement. Its your bad stacking. Its all of these things. You're not using your mana correctly. Your skillbuilds are aweful. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOg1OPbJL28&feature=youtu.be&t=2726
This is the problem with 1K MMR Players. They basically just show up and they stand around and eventually somebody dies. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mMmipyJH1g&feature=youtu.be&t=4048
OOOH NOOOOO OHHHH NOOOOO MISTAAAKKEEEE | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQVVFQjBmiQ&feature=youtu.be&t=269
I'm gonna screw you: you had a really shit early game! | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQVVFQjBmiQ&feature=youtu.be&t=1916
Tirade over Coffin | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQVVFQjBmiQ&feature=youtu.be&t=2013
Fuck slacks | https://youtu.be/Xb3073mNJ2Y?t=373
You're basically not even playing Dota. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mMmipyJH1g&feature=youtu.be&t=1507
That was a pretty big mistake | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiZzrBWhG4o&feature=youtu.be&t=2742
